# Effect-of-Handwashing-Data-analysis
Analyzing the Impact of Mandatory Handwashing on Births and Deaths

## 1. Project Overview
In this data analysis project, we investigate the effects of implementing mandatory handwashing protocols on births and deaths. The initiative aimed to assess whether the introduction of compulsory handwashing practices influenced mortality rates, particularly in healthcare settings. By examining trends in births and deaths before and after the implementation of handwashing protocols, we aim to uncover insights into the efficacy of such interventions in improving public health outcomes.
